# Energy Pallet

Energy pallet provides an alternative system to pay transaction fees, with the ability to fallback
to paying for fees using the native tokens when energy is not enough. A key difference is that energy **cannot be transferred**
between accounts. Energy can be generated by burning the native token with one to one ratio. The value of energy is determined using a value coefficient
  * **Example:** if `1` native token can be used to pay the fees of `12` transactions, and the value coefficient is
  `6.4` then `1` energy can pay the fees of `76` transactions (`12 * 6.4 = 76.8 ~= 76`).
